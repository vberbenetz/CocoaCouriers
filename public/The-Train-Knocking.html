								<p>So the other day I had the freakiest tinder date I've ever had. Let me clarify that "Freaky" is fucking awesome! So I was pretty bored and down to my last few right swipes for the day and I matched with this redhead chick with a great body, duh I swiped right.
                                I started up a conversation with her and jokingly asked her to come watch Netflix and Chill, thinking she would respond with "lol" and then i'd respond with "haha JK" but that didn't happen. She responded with "K but you have to pick me up, my parents borrowed my car". :O wtf, wow jackpot.
                                So I jumped in the car with a semi-chub and headed about 10 minutes down into the city to pick this chick up and head back to my place.</p>

                                <p>When I rolled up to her house she came out and jumped into my passenger seat, she wasn't as hot as the picture would have me believe but I DGAF this was going down, I was already pot committed (poker reference).
                                About half way back to my place there is a train track that blocks the road when a train is passing, its almost always one of those GD trains that rolls by for 20 mins, comes to a hault and then rolls backwards blocking you for even longer.
                                I attribute this to the rail yard just up the track a bit.</p>

                                <p>Anyways, we got stuck at the very beginning of a train passing the arms where coming down and flashing and shit so I had to stop. I thought twice about punching it and pulling some action movie stunt blowing away the wooden blocking arms.
                                but that didn't happen. At this point we really hadn't said anything out of the ordinary to each other, just chatting about age, work, likes/dislikes etc, but now I was in for 20 minutes of forced conversation I thought.</p>

                                <p>The conversation had some awkward pauses and wasn't really flowing all that well, at this point I'd be happy if we could just get home and throw on a movie and make out. But during one of the awkward silences this chick reaches accross the car and
                                unbuckles my belt and reaches into my pants, I was sitting there shocked as shit but I wasn't about to stop her. Not even 20 seconds later this girl has her head in my lap giving me the best train wait i've ever had, but
                                it didn't stop there! She asked me to pull my seat back so I did, she was wearing a skirt but evidently not any panties since her next move was hopping over the stick shift right onto my lap. </p>

                                <p>At this point there was no discretion about that was going on in here, I had two or three cars behind me and I don't have tinted windows either. It must have been clear as day what was happening to
                                the cars behind me. 0 fucks given at this point by either one of us, she asked me to slip on a condom and it just so happened I had just got my first DomerBox shipment, I was set for the night :D.
                                I quickly slipped on a jimmy and went to town till the wooden arms came up. At this point there were 5 cars behind me waiting to get by so I threw on my all way blinkers and opened the window enough to get my arm out and wave the ppl behined me
                                through... after all the cars passed I started the car with her still on top of me and pulled over to the side of the road where there was some gravel. We jumped in the back seat and continued for another 15 minutes.</p>

                                <p>After we were all finished up, I asked her if she still wanted to watch a movie and she flat out told me she'd rather just head home and relax. I said no problem, turned the car around with a U-bird and drove her back home.
                                After dropping her off I was overwhelmed with a smile I couldn't get rid of. This was my Tinder peak, nothing can beat what happened to me that day. Thank You Deeply DomerBox, I truly love you, if you're ever in Grand Rapids message me and the beers are on me.
